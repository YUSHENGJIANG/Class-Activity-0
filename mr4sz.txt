I have taken two embedded systems related courses in my undergraduate studies and the platforms used were Intel 8051 and MSP 430.
I have also worked with industrial ECMs for hardware in loop simulation as a part of my job.
I expect to learn the best design and coding practices for embedded systms from this course.

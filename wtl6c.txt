William Trace LaCour (wtl6c)

I have taken Intro to Embedded with Todd Delong
I also spent my summer programming the UVA Cubesat. 

I am hoping to "git" some experience with larger programs. This would cover increasingly more complex programs as well
as the organization of all components within the program and how to insure the accuracy of the program.

I've worked with embedded systems a few times before. Most recently I took Prof DeLong's
intro to embedded class working with the MSP430. I've also used Arduino and Teensyduino
for research projects in my undergrad studies at Washington and Lee. I'm also working on a
multiple projects now programing beaglebones. As far as programming languages are concerned,
I've used Python, Matlab, C, C++, JavaScript, and Java at varying degrees of familiarity.

For this course I'm hoping to gained an increased confidence in working with embedded systems,
and not be as reliant on those around me as I have in the past. I'd like to solidify the knowledge
of embedded systems I already posses, and learn newer advanced topics.

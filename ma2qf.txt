I've taken ECE 3430 where I have did class projects in MSP 430.
We made a 2d potentiometer which measured gravity and involved a 
lot of embedded concepts. I have some experience with Arduino boards.
I'm proficient in C, C++, C#, Java. I have some SQL and Python experience.

I'm interested in working with embedded systems in consumer electronics.
I also enjoy messing around with Analog circuits and I'm currently
learning RF circuits. I want to learn how to design more complex
Embedded systems and possibly how devices communicate with networks
(by FM, bluetooth, Wifi).

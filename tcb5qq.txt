I have taken ECE 3430, and CS 2150. I have used C programming for AVR and MSP430, as well as some Z80 assembly. I contributed a small patch to the memory management of an operating system for Z80 based TI calculators and have worked on many small projects with microcontroller dev boards.
I'm interested to learn about the internals of RTOS's, and also about memory mapped system design. I look forward to working on the projects in this course and learning a new architecture.
